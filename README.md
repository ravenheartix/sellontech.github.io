This is the readme for my project website.

There isn't much to read in the readme.

To quickly see the site - Go to: https://ravenheartix.github.io/sellontech.github.io/

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this repository and the project itself really is to bolster my skills in HTML, JAVA, and CSS.
I have very little experience as of yet other than classes I took in highschool 10+ years ago.


**Current Objectives:**
1. Build a simple yet beautiful project site.
2. Build a clean navigation menu.
3. Add design elements such as color theme and media.
4. Embed my stream on my Twitch internal page.


**Future Ambitions:**
1. Purchase a custom domain - will be deployed soon after purchase as Github Pages allows for custom domain use. <s>(Expected Completion: End of June 2024).</s> (Expected Completion: Unknown).
2. Move off of GitHub Pages - going to experiment with self hosting this project site from a Raspberry Pi. <s>(Expected Completion: End of Summer 2024).</s> (Expected Completion: Unknown).
3. Start a blog - either through a seperate blog service or through my own Page and starting blogging. <s>(Expected Completion: End of Summer 2024)</s>. (Expected Completion: End of 2024 Using a blog service).
